  - title: Who are you?
    answer: My name is [Roger Campbell](https://abqcampbells.com), and I am the founder of this business and only employee right now. I have a wife, family and friends that help out with advice, and I use AI tools to help things go quickly and efectively. If you click on my name, you can find out a little more about me and my experience. <br/><br/> I will engage contractors and additional engineers as needed to ensure the business grows and our clients are satisfied.

  - title: What can you do for us?
    answer: I can quickly assess your idea for a software project to give you an idea of what it would take to create and get it in front of customers. I have a lot of experience with cloud services, databases and web apps. I have done recent work utilizing AI tools, automated agents and voice interfaces and am interested in doing more of this. My focus is on getting smaller projects working in weeks or months and deployed to users. Then we iterate and make changes based on user feedback and as requirements come into better focus. My preferred way of operating is to have at least one weekly status meeting by video, regular communications by email and multiple deployments per week demonstrating progress.

  - title: How long will it take?
    answer: That depends on the size and scope of your project, but I will not be taking on a project with extensive or complicated requirements. I am a firm believer in getting software in front of users quickly, so I'd expect to have at least a demo or MVP (minimum viable product) in a few weeks or less. From that point, we continue making changes and improvements with weekly deployments to users. You decide when it is "done", and we can continue in an operational mode or provide instructions to move and maintain yourself. My hope is to have long-term relationships with clients, where we build, maintain and operate software systems for years. Those that don't work for some reason get replaced with others that work better for your customers.

  - title: How much will it cost?
    answer: An initial call via phone or video conference is free. Expect that call to include a short "getting to know each other" followed by a series of questions attempting to get to your requirements. It helps greatly to have some of those requirements either written down or thought about ahead of time. After that, I will get back to you with 1) some additional questions 2) suggestion directing you to find help elsewhere - or 3) a proposal to move forward. <br/><br/> I will keep your call in confidence. If you require an NDA to talk with me, please move on to someone else. <br/><br/> A monthly engagement will be at least $10K and is cancellable at any time. If you decide to cancel, you will have a Github project with code that belongs to you along with deployment instructions for one of the major cloud providers.
