  - title: Who are you?
    answer: My name is [Roger Campbell](https://abqcampbells.com), and I'm the founder—and currently the only full-time employee—of this business. I work closely with trusted advisors, contractors, and cutting-edge AI tools to move quickly and deliver results.<br/><br/> You can click on my name to learn more about my background. As needed, I bring in engineers and specialists to ensure we meet client goals and maintain a high standard of quality.

  - title: What can you do for us?
    answer: "I can help turn your software idea into something real—fast. My background includes cloud services, web applications, AI/ML tools, and voice interfaces. I specialize in launching small, focused projects within weeks, then iterating based on real user feedback. <br/><br/> You'll get:<br/>• Clear technical guidance<br/>• Weekly video check-ins<br/>• Frequent deployments showing progress<br/>• A practical, user-focused approach from start to finish"

  - title: How long will it take?
    answer: Most small projects should have a demo or MVP (minimum viable product) within a few weeks. From there, we refine the product with ongoing improvements and regular releases. <br/><br/> I don’t take on large or unclear projects—I believe in launching quickly, learning fast, and adapting. You decide when it’s “done,” but I’m happy to support long-term operation and evolution of the software.

  - title: How much will it cost?
    answer: • Initial call - Free and confidential  <br/>• Monthly engagement - Starts at $10K/month, cancel anytime  <br/>• What you get - Source code in a GitHub repo you own, plus deployment instructions for a major cloud provider <br/><br/> If you need an NDA to start the conversation, I’m not the right fit. But if you’re ready to talk honestly and move quickly, let’s schedule that first call. Leave a message at 1 (575) 587-7800.
